</strong></p><p><strong>The increased complexity of modern aerospace and defense electronics demands highly-automated testing to achieve the perfection required of each component.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Automotive
</strong></p><p><strong>As vehicles advance toward autonomous operation, test engineers face drastically increasing system complexity while dealing with ever-present cost and time pressure.
</strong></p><p><strong>RenoTEQ delivers test systems that use the most advanced test methods to ensure engineers get what they need: real-time results based on accurate data.
</strong></p><p><strong>RenoTEQ’s architectural expertise allows us to design and build testing solutions that can address the root causes of the difficulty of testing this complexity: 
</strong></p><p><strong>device inter-communication, 
</strong></p><p><strong>Scope Creeps, 
</strong></p><p><strong>massive configurability, 
</strong></p><p><strong>and configuration management. 
</strong></p><p><strong>RenoTEQ’s experience allows us to integrate testing across each point in the ‘V’ model, incorporating any mix of MIL, SIL, or HIL components for any scale of test from unit test to full system test. JET’s focus on workflow allows us to propose and design solutions that allow for extensive test code reuse to maximize value and deliver test results that provide clarity about the specifics of the test conditions and results. RenoTEQ’s commitment to partnering with clients, ensures that feedback from stakeholders is incorporated early and often to build confidence in a quality solution.
</strong></p><p><strong>Electro Mechanical Testing
</strong></p><p><strong>The CompactRIO based Control and Monitoring System helps customers achieve those goals. Test System that developed with NI software and VeriStand test system configuration help customers get up and running faster. You can connect sensors and tune parameters to start controlling loads immediately. The number of control loops can just as easily be expanded to meet more complex application needs.
</strong></p><p><strong>RenoTEQ supports also in electro mechanical testing for the systems 
</strong></p><p><strong>Traction system
</strong></p><p><strong>Gear box Testing
</strong></p><p><strong>Shaft Testing
</strong></p><p><strong>Dashboard Testing
</strong></p><p><strong>Hardware-In-Loop
</strong></p><p><strong>RenoTEQ supplies test setup, where the PXI performs extensive HIL testing by simulating all the sensor inputs that would normally exist if the controller were physically installed in the vehicle. Using a graphics card and a host of PXI I/O, we create a virtual car inside a virtual world that our device under test (DUT) can control. This helps us to assess how well our device can control the virtual car. In short, we use software to simulate a test environment for a complex system of sensors and controllers to validate their capabilities.
</strong></p><p><strong>

</strong></p><p><strong>APPROACH
</strong></p><p><strong>We take a holistic approach to software design and undertake all projects from a “Systems Engineering” standpoint.
</strong></p><p><strong>We deliberately create multidisciplinary teams, comprising not only a software specialist but also team members with other skills and real world experience such as more generic software processes, hardware design, manufacturing and specialist sensors integration. These complementary skills allow us to review the project from many different perspectives to ensure we deliver the best solution possible, given all constraints.
</strong></p><p><strong>Transparency and robust quality processes are essential to successful delivery, therefore, all our projects – large or small – follow the same development process. The creation of documents and diagrams throughout the project, including change tracking and version control procedures, ensures that the final system meets your requirements and expectations.
</strong></p><p><strong>SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE &amp; DESIGN PROCESS
</strong></p><p><strong>The aim of system architecture and design is to create a modular, cohesive, yet scalable and extendable framework that is easy to use and understand. In general, each project follows a number of architecture/design steps:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Work with you to identify your requirements
</strong></p><p><strong>Introduce hardware solution(s) to meet your specific needs
</strong></p><p><strong>Identify your application/project boundaries and interfaces
</strong></p><p><strong>Identify the whole solution architecture required including hardware and software
</strong></p><p><strong>Split the solution into software and hardware teams (if required)
</strong></p><p><strong>[Software] Break the solution down to modular blocks with defined interfaces and test harnesses
</strong></p><p><strong>Develop/re-use and test individual blocks/modules
</strong></p><p><strong>Integrate the code together to create a top level application, then test
</strong></p><p><strong>Build and test the fully compiled application
</strong></p><p><strong>TRAINING &amp; SUPPORT
</strong></p><p><strong>It is critical to ensure that all projects – existing or a new – are optimised to gain maximum performance, utilisation, and financial return. To address your project time and cost risks, we provide training and support tailored to your individual specification:
